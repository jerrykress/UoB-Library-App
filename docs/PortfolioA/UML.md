## Dynamic UML
This diagram details the flow of data as a request to the WMS API is made to get the data on a particular user. The data would be loaded from the user when they sign in to the applicaiton. This part of the system is modelled as it can very nicely show how data will flow around different parts of our system, from request to response and details the different stages it will need to take before the final object is created and handled, in this case displayed to the user. This requesting and response would be contained mostly within the big WMS box in the high level architecture diagram with the WMS API circle representing the same in the high level architecture. This show a higher level of abstraction of one part of the WMS Class in the high level architecture, more specifically this puts in more detail the handling of communication with the NCIP API for the WMS Service.
