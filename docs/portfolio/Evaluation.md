How did we document the feedback we got.


How did we use the feedback to refine the app 

Most if not all of the user testing, refinement and feedback came directly from the end-users.
Most of our discussions and improvements came from imformal discussions with random UoB students studying in the university libraries. We have a few samples written as questionnaires which facilitated a few of our biggest changes but there were other changes we made within the application that were solely as a result of informal discussions with students.

Arguably our biggest change coming as a result of user testing was the side-bar revamp and upgrade. We had two models with the team being 50/50 as to which would be better. Asking students, it was clear this was a no contest, rather than guessing what the end-user would like, we asked and delivered exactly what they wanted.

We gave these random users a small brief
- "This is a beta version of the new app we are developing for the UoB libraries."

and some tasks such as:
- "Take this phone and this book and checkout the book to your library account"
- "Take this phone, the application icon is here, now, use it and tell us what functionality you can see"

and watched the users as they interacted with our system. 

From watching the users interact with the system, we found the login flow and the navigation system being very simple to use. 

Every user we surveyed found the login very easy to do, partly because it uses SSO and looks identical to the library page. Additonally, every user we surveyed also found their way around the system without any problems, with the navigation pane, it is virtually impossible to get lost.

On the flipside, checking out a book initially seemed to be a very difficult process with every user featuring some sort of complexity. We firstly altered the floating action bar icon from a camera to an NFC, barcode looking, icon which helped prompt users in this direction. 

We fixed the difficulty locating the scan a new book page but we still had a problem once we were at the checkout a new book page.

Despite instructions being clearly written, users seemed to ignore this, get confused and ask us for help so we added a "Show me how" button at the end of the page which when pressed displayed the instructions. This helped remedy the problem however some users would use the phone as a barcode reader, some users as a camera and one user putting the book over the phone, thinking it would pick up the weight of the book, before actually reading the instructions.

We created an animation and added a powerful visual clue to the users which replaced the NFC logo on the checkout page, users now were greeted to an animation showing 2 stage, one where a book is open on the last page showing the tag and the other stage where the user was scanning the tag with the phone. Newly sampled users had no difficulties checking out a book - problem solved.
