## User Goal Flows

The key user goals of our app are to be able to login and checkout books, below we have designed the user flow:

### Login

* Basic Flow:
    * Open Application
    * Select UoB Login
    * Input email
    * Input password
    * Choose if you would like to remain logged in
    * Allow permission for the application to access your library account
    * Direct to app home page
* Alternative Flow:
    * When selecting UoB login, the user may choose to login as an External User
* Exceptional Flow:
    * The user decides to close the app part-way through logging in
    * The user loses internet connection while logging in.


### Checkout Book

* Basic Flow:
    * Select library branch
    * Hold phone over RFID tag in book
    * Wait for checkout process to complete
    * Dismiss confirmation message
* Alternative Flow:
    * After scanning the RFID tag once, phone is moved away from book and looses connection to the RFID tag
    * Ask user to rescan the book, to disable the security
* Exceptional Flow:
    * User scans the book, removes before the checkout process is complete, then exits the app.
    * User scans a book that cannot be taken from library (reference book).


### Cancel Reservations

* Basic Flow:
    * Open reservation page
    * Select reservation
    * Select cancel reservation
* Alternative Flow:
    * Perform login as described
    * User has unpaid fines, shows warning on homepage and can choose to be directed to payment webpage
    * User account is blocked, shows "account blocked" page, redirect to instrutions to visit service desk
* Exceptional Flow:
    * User has no internet connection
    * SSO is offline.
    * App will not work if WMS is offline, redirect to offline circulations info page.





## Flow Decomposition

We have chosen to decompose the goal - Checkout Book:

* Once the checkout process is started the app should check the user library account status to ensure they are able to checkout a book.
* The user should select their library branch. This could be done automatically using geofencing.
* The user should then be asked to scan the RFID tag in the book.
* The application reads the barcode from the book.
* The application communiates with the OCLC WMS Platform to checkout the book.
* If the checkout is successful, then the books security status on the RFID should be turned off, so that alarms do not sound.
* The application should show a confirmation to inform the user the book has been checkout out.
* If the checkout is not successful, then inform the user of the reason for failure.

This docomposition leads to the following requirements for checking out a book
