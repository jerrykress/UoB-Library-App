## Troubleshooting

### Account Blocked

If your account is blocked you will be unable to checkout books. The reasons for your account being blocked can be found [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/use/borrowing/). If you are still unsure why your account is blocked, speak to a librarian who will be able to assist you.

### Book Wont Scan

There are several reasons why a book wont scan, they are:

 - The book has already been checked out to another library user.
 - The book is a reference book and cannot be taken out of the library.
 - You have reached the borrowing limit. Please see [this](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/use/borrowing/) to check your borrowing limits.

### Loan is always due tomorrow

1 day loans will always have due date of tomorrow but in mny cases they will likely automatically renew, if it fails to you will receive an email informing you that the book is now due back. Due to technical restrictions we are unable to detect if a loan will automatically renew.
