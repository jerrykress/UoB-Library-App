## Troubleshooting

### App

If your loans fail to update, this is likely due to your phone not being connected to the internet. Ensure your phone is connected to the internet and try again.

### Scan page wont open

If the scan page fails to open for any reason, it will display a message informing you of why. The reasons for it failing to open are:

- Your account is blocked, see bellow.
- You have reached your borrowing limit. Please see [this](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/use/borrowing/) to check your borrowing limits.
- Your phone is not nfc enabled. To checkout books, your phone must be capable of scanning the tags inside the book.
- Your phone is not connected to the internet. To checkout a book, we must connect to the library system, this is only possible with a working internet connection.

### Account Blocked

If your account is blocked you will be unable to checkout books. The reasons for your account being blocked can be found [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/use/borrowing/). If you are still unsure why your account is blocked, speak to a librarian who will be able to assist you.


### Book Wont Scan

There are several reasons why a book will not scan, they are:

 - The book has already been checked out to another library user.
 - The book is a reference book and cannot be taken out of the library.
 - You have reached the borrowing limit. 


### Loan is always due tomorrow

1 day loans will always have due date of tomorrow but in many cases they will likely automatically renew, if it fails to automatically renew, you will receive an email informing you that the book is now due back.
